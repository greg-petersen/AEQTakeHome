## Part 1: The Castle Company

### castle.py

The castle.py has a function that accepts an input array of integers from which
it determines how many castles should be built based on the following criteria:

`A castle will only be built in a valley or on a peak.`

`A peak is an integer or series of integers that is above the immediately preceding
and following ints. I.E: [5,7,7,6,2] the sequence of 2 7s is a peak.`

`A valley is an integer or series of integers that is below the immediately preceding
and following ints. I.E: [5,3,2,2,5] the sequence of 2 2s is a valley.`

#### How to use:
From command line call:

`$ python3 castle.py`

The input array can be changed inside of the file to be a specific input array,
 for now it passes in a randomly generated array of integers.

## Part 2: The Transformation Company
